= NOTE: INSTALLING THIS PLUGIN ALONE DOES NOT MAKE YOUR SITE GDPR COMPLIANT. SINCE EACH SITE USES DIFFERENT COOKIES, YOU NEED TO ENSURE YOU HAVE THE NECESSARY CONFIGURATIONS IN PLACE WITH A SUPPORTING COOKIE NOTICE. = 


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Check out our [setup guide](https://www.cookieyes.com/documentation/install-cookieyes-wordpress-plugin/) for getting started with the CookieYes GDPR Cookie Consent plugin.

= The cookie notice header doesn’t work on my browser =
Please report a bug on the support forum. Be sure to include the following information:

* Your URL (We need it to help you!)
* WordPress version e.g. 4.2.2 (found in the bottom right-hand corner of the dashboard)
* Browser the issue is seen on (e.g. Firefox, Chrome, IE)
* Describe the problem

The more information you give, the quicker we can respond.

= What does this plugin do? =
This plugin will:

1. Add a cookie banner to the top/bottom of all pages on your website, notifying the visitor that you have a clearly defined privacy and cookie policy.
2. Allow you to record which cookies your site uses, and:
3. Neatly display a list of these cookies. You can add this list to your Privacy Policy page or Cookie Policy page using a shortcode. Note: If you connect your site to the CookieYes web app, you have to replace the shortcode with an HTML code.

= Do visitors now have to accept/refuse cookies in order to use websites? =
No. Only the ‘Necessary’ cookies will be loaded till the user gives consent. 

= Does this plugin stop cookies from being stored? =
The visitors can reject the category of cookies they don’t want to get installed. In such cases, all cookies in that category will be blocked for the user.

But if another plugin adds scripts or places a cookie then we do not have any control. We have no way of knowing what plugins you use or how they work, so blocking/deleting cookies on a WordPress website/blog would possibly/probably break your site. Larger websites with huge budgets may well invest in such technology, but this plugin aims to help you provide a certain level of compliance without taking drastic action.

= Does this plugin guarantee that I comply with this law? =
This plugin can be used to comply with the cookie consent requirements of major data privacy laws such as the GDPR. However, you need to assess your website’s use of cookies to confirm that it is in line with the GDPR guidelines. If you are looking for specialist legal advice relating to your website, we suggest that you consult a lawyer to understand how you can become fully GDPR-compliant.


== Installation ==

= Automatic installation =

The automatic installation is the easiest way to install the plugin. You can install the plugin within your WordPress dashboard from the same browser window.
 
From your admin dashboard, go to Plugins > Add New. From the search box, type “GDPR Cookie consent” or just “gdpr” and then search. Click the install button on the GDPR Cookie Consent by CookieYes and then activate the plugin.

= Manual installation =

In the manual installation, you will need to download the zip file of the plugin from the plugin page in WordPress.org. You can upload the file directly from your WordPress dashboard, or using an FTP application.

When doing a manual installation

1.  Upload the plugin folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory.
2.  Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress.

= Plugin updates =

For every update of the plugin, you will be notified of the installed plugins page. You can directly update the plugin from your dashboard. We recommend that you keep the latest version of the plugin so that you can avail yourself of the new functionalities and security features.
